### What does your app do?
Our app allows users to search for recipes using their current ingredients. It would then allow them to text the information of the recipe as well as their missing ingredients to the person in charge of grocery shopping. It will additionally have the option of giving the user locations with the best prices for the ingredients they need.
### Who worked on it?
1. Honorio worked on finding appropriate api's for price searching. 
2. Marilyn worked on the User Profile as well as the Settings Screen.
3. Lorenzo worked on - Facebook Login.
4. Jason Sagisi worked on the My Ingredients and the Recipe List Screens.
5. Jason Ferrer worked on the Main Screen as well as the Main Search Screen of the application.

### What were you able to complete for this handin?
We were able to accomplish the following:
  -We have managed to create most of the screens we need for the project, bar the screen for the camera option of the search screen.\n
  -The Facebook login has been integrated into the project.\n
  -We have started researching the different API's we will need for the next handin.
### What are known problems, if any, with your project?
Known problems are:
  -It needs work until all the screens are connected to one another.\n
  -The camera screen still needs to be programmed.\n
  -We still need to get a better handle on using github as we haven't utilized much branching.
### How would you improve it if you had more time?
If we had more time we would have definitely integrated the screens better to each other. We would have also experimented with branching our project and merging our codes with one another. Additionally we would have programmed the camera screen as well. And maybe even styled the screens better than they currently are.
