### What does your app do?
Our app allows users to search for recipes using their current ingredients. It would then allow them to text the information of the recipe as well as their missing ingredients to the person in charge of grocery shopping.

### Who worked on it?
1. Honorio worked on connecting the database to our application and landing page.
   Worked with teammates and offered help where it was necessary
2. Marilyn worked on the integration of the SMS API as well as on the recipe API Spoonacular. She also is the one that created and applied the theme and overall look of our application.
3. Lorenzo worked on the Facebook API as well as the Spoonacular API. He also helped with the Clarifai API.
4. Jason Sagisi worked on integrating the Recipe API in order to choose the recipes for the app.
5. Jason Ferrer worked on the Camera function of the app as well as connecting the Clarifai API to the application. He also helped with some of the minor applications.

### What were you able to complete for this handin?
We were able to accomplish the following:
Our app is now fully connected and can run through some of the stories we created in the project proposal. You can now log in to Facebook and see that the user profile reflects the identity of the user. You can now enter by text, a list of ingredients in order to search for recipes using the Spoonacular API. You can now also send said recipe as well as missing ingredients needed to a potential grocer using the SMS API. We have also set the foundations for the camera recognition API and have now connected an external database to our application.

### What are known problems, if any, with your project?
Known problems are:
  -The camera recognition still needs to be done.
  
### How would you improve it if you had more time?
We would have definitely finished the camera recognition feature of the app.
