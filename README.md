### What does your app do?
Our app allows users to search for recipes using their current ingredients. It would then allow them to text the information of the recipe as well as their missing ingredients to the person in charge of grocery shopping.

### Who worked on it?
1. Honorio worked on connecting the database to our application.
2. Marilyn worked on the integration of the SMS API as well as on the recipe API Spoonacular. She also is the one that created and applied the theme and overall look of our application.
3. Lorenzo worked on the Facebook API as well as the Spoonacular API. He also helped with the Clarifai API.
4. Jason Sagisi worked on integrating the Recipe API in order to choose the recipes for the app.
5. Jason Ferrer worked on the Camera function of the app as well as connecting the Clarifai API to the application. He also helped with some of the minor applications.

### What were you able to complete for this handin?
We were able to accomplish the following:
Our app is now fully connected and can run through some of the stories we created in the project proposal. You can now log in to Facebook and see that the user profile reflects the identity of the user. You can now enter by text, a list of ingredients in order to search for recipes using the Spoonacular API. You can now also send said recipe as well as missing ingredients needed to a potential grocer using the SMS API. We have also set the foundations for the camera recognition API and have now connected an external database to our application.

### What are known problems, if any, with your project?
Known problems are:
  -We still need to create the database and use the information in them to fill in the screens that use them such as the My fridge and My Recipes screens.
  -It still needs to be styled more with customized aesthetics instead of using the default android style.
  -The camera recognition still needs to be done though it is scheduled to be completed in the 3rd handin.
  
### How would you improve it if you had more time?
If we had more time we would have definitely created the database and filled out the screens that uses them as earlier explained. We would also have added more uniqueness to the style of the overall application, though the logo we have now is definitely a nice touch. And if we could have, we would have liked to have worked ahead and finish the camera recognition feature of the app.
